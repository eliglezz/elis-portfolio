# elis-portfolio
This was a homework assignment. 
I tried to create a similar layout although I did take some artistic liberties. 
I went for a little bit of a simple design with minimal pictures. 
I got it to look good (in my opinion of course) and am happy with the results. 
I don't have enough work online to populate everything but I did what I could. 
I will probably come back to the about me section some time but it wil be lorem ipsum for now.
The hardest part was getting the boxes to work properly; It was probably what I spent the longest doing. 
I ended up doing an overhaul at one point.
I had to how grids worked but I now have a good grasp on what im doing now.
I am sure I will look back at this and see how obvious mistakes.
